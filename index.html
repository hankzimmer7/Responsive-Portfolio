                <p>I was born in Colorado Springs, Colorado, and lived in Colorado until the age of 21. I went to college at the Colorado School of Mines studying Mechanical Engineering. I then moved to Seattle and worked there for six years as a nuclear engineer, but ultimately decided that engineering isn't my passion. I'm now learning web development, and hope to gain enough skill to have a lifelong career as a web developer.</p>
                <p>My favorite activities include playing video games, trying new foods, and traveling. I haven't been spending a lot of time playing video games lately, but some of my favorites are the Final Fantasy series. I started playing Final Fantasy 15 when it came out in 2016, but never got too far in the storyline. I hope to someday pick the game back up and continue since it's one of my favorite video game series.</p>
                <p>I love trying new foods, and one of my favorite types is sushi. My favorite overall Japanese restaraunt I have been to in Atlanta thus far is Ginya Izakaya. I love it there because the menu is huge and it reminds me of Izakaya joints in Japan. I spent 6 months working in Japan, and would love to go back someday to vacation.</p>
